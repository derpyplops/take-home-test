I am James from \nUser: Yeah.\nAgent: Kaplan Singapore, just following up on your interest in the Information Technology degree with Bristol University. No worries about the timing\u2014what time after five works best for you for a quick call back?\nUser: Or lunchtime?\nUser: is \nAgent: Sure \nUser: also okay if you call about one one one o'clock, one thirty?\nAgent: Alright, \nUser: But it's not a \nAgent: Vivek. I can \nUser: government course, ma'am. That that's why. We'll be finishing off the full stack junior course with transition Singapore.\nUser: This week.\nAgent: Thanks for sharing, Vivek. You are right, the \nUser: Yeah. And\nAgent: Information Technology degree with Kaplan and Bristol University is not a government-funded course, so SkillsFuture credits cannot be used. But we do offer education grants and flexible payment options to help with fees.\n\nSince you are finishing your full stack junior course this week, would you like me to call you back after you are done, or would you prefer a call during \nUser: Okay.\nUser: Yeah. I think that'd be the best thing.\nUser: Yeah. That'd be that'd be best. I mean, I this It's it's the part that I wanted to look into cybersecurity.\nUser: but if you're looking at the best bachelor's degree, right, there's also options there are options from NTU also for me because I'm a single born here. So it comes from a PACE. I think, p a c e, thing where they actually offered me something because I'm I'm not I'm I'm unemployed at this moment.\nAgent: That \nUser: So NTU, \nAgent: makes sense, Vivek.\nUser: actually. Yeah. Correct. So they will speak more maybe at two estimates. You mean, maybe next week?\nAgent: Got it, Vivek. Sounds like you are \nUser: Yeah.\nAgent: weighing your options between NTU and Kaplan for your next step in cybersecurity, especially since NTU has some support \nUser: Yeah. Correct. M q will definitely be the first option.\nUser: think my father-in-law in about billiard, basically. Even though I came from Nagang Poly before my before my NS and all that. You know? So I think it makes sense. I'm forty two years of age, so I have to keep my my children be happy also. Yeah. But I just want to know more about the cybersecurity in terms of it is being heavily funded How much do I have to, you know, come out of my pocket?\nUser: that's that's one of the most important thing. Mean, being a brave enough a expert dinner for the house, you know, behind the where you you know, we what what how much money is gonna come up. But the n p u one, the parent they bought something which is much more lucrative.\nUser: Because, you know, since you do you don't have a job, I think they they they allow me to use CPF or something, but I don't don't don't question me yet because I haven't really go in and speak with them more, but they told me that I am because I came I came from HR background. Over the years.\nAgent: Thanks for sharing all that, Vivek. I totally get where \nUser: Yeah.\nAgent: you are coming from\u2014cost is a huge factor, especially when you are supporting your family and looking for the best value.\n\nFor the Information Technology degree at Kaplan, SkillsFuture and CPF cannot be used, but there are education grants, study loans, and 0% instalment plans to help with fees. The exact amount you will need to pay depends on the programme, and your advisor can break down all the costs and payment options for you.\n\nWould you like me to arrange a call with a Kaplan advisor next week, maybe around 2 PM, so you can get all the details and compare your options?\nUser: Okay.\nUser: Okay.\nUser: Okay. So I I also believe you one more thing. It's not a waste waste people's time because people's time is, of course, an essence for me too.\nUser: me \nAgent: Absolutely, \nUser: finish up this this course first. If you can follow-up with me next Monday or Tuesday, Jamie, because next week is this Friday, is our submission for capstone.\nUser: And then the following week would be my interviews with companies like Tata and all that. Let's see whether I'll end the job or not.\nUser: I am hopeful. And at the same time, if it doesn't work that way, then I will have to look at, you know, growing myself further by doing you know, of course, I do some ad hoc with with with with companies to to sustain. So let's just speak on Monday or Tuesday. I think Tuesday will be the best thing.\nUser: Next Tuesday.\nAgent: Thanks for sharing, Vivek. That sounds like a solid \nUser: No problem. \nAgent: plan\u2014let us see how things go with your interviews first. I will follow up with you \nUser: Sure.\nAgent: Great, Vivek.
