Agent: Information Technology degree with Kaplan and Bristol University is not a government-funded course, so SkillsFuture credits cannot be used. But we do offer education grants and flexible payment options to help with fees.

I think, p a c e, thing where they actually offered me something because I'm I'm not I'm I'm unemployed at this moment.

User: Because, you know, since you do you don't have a job, I think they they they allow me to use CPF or something, but I don't don't don't question me yet because I haven't really go in and speak with them more, but they told me that I am because I came I came from HR background. Over the years.
Agent: Thanks for sharing all that, Vivek. I totally get where 
User: Yeah.
Agent: you are coming from—cost is a huge factor, especially when you are supporting your family and looking for the best value.

For the Information Technology degree at Kaplan, SkillsFuture and CPF cannot be used, but there are education grants, study loans, and 0% instalment plans to help with fees. The exact amount you will need to pay depends on the programme, and your advisor can break down all the costs and payment options for you.

Would you like me to arrange a call with a Kaplan advisor next week, maybe around 2 PM, so you can get all the details and compare your options?
User: Okay.
User: Okay.
